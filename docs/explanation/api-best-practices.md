# API Best Practices

This document explains best practices for working with the Voucher API. It covers key concepts and recommended approaches for validation, advanced types, and analytics to help you build robust integrations.

## Validation Best Practices

### Validation Timing

Proper timing of validation requests ensures a smooth user experience and system reliability:

- **Early Validation**: Validate vouchers as soon as users enter them to provide immediate feedback and improve user experience.
- **Revalidation**: Always revalidate vouchers before applying them, as conditions may have changed between validation and application.
- **Caching**: Cache validation results for a short period to improve performance, but ensure they're refreshed when needed.

### Error Handling

Effective error handling improves both system reliability and user experience:

- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Handle all possible error cases and provide clear, actionable error messages to users.
- **Logging**: Log validation failures for monitoring and debugging purposes.

### Performance Optimization

Optimizing validation performance ensures a responsive user experience:

- Use efficient validation algorithms
- Implement caching strategies
- Monitor response times
- Use database indexes for voucher lookups

## Advanced Types Best Practices

### Configuration

Properly configuring advanced voucher types ensures they work as expected:

- **Validation Testing**: Always test advanced voucher configurations with various scenarios to ensure they work as expected.
- **Edge Cases**: Consider edge cases like overlapping tiers, conflicting conditions, and stacking limits during configuration.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Monitor the performance impact of complex voucher types, especially conditional and stackable vouchers.

### Implementation

Implementing advanced voucher types requires careful planning:

- **Conflict Resolution**: Implement clear rules for handling conflicts between different voucher types and stacking scenarios.
- **Usage Tracking**: Track usage patterns for advanced vouchers to understand their effectiveness and prevent abuse.
- **Change Logging**: Log all changes to advanced voucher configurations for audit purposes and troubleshooting.

### Testing

Thorough testing ensures advanced voucher types work correctly:

- **Comprehensive Testing**:
  - Test all possible combinations of conditions
  - Verify discount calculations for edge cases
  - Validate stacking behavior with multiple vouchers
  - Check performance with high-volume scenarios

- **Integration Testing**:
  - Test with real order data
  - Validate against existing voucher types
  - Ensure compatibility with validation endpoints
  - Verify analytics tracking for advanced types

## Analytics Best Practices

### Data Collection

Effective data collection provides valuable insights:

- Track all voucher interactions including views, attempts, and successful applications to get complete insights
- Set up real-time alerts for unusual patterns or performance drops to respond quickly to issues
- Analyze performance by customer segments, geographic regions, and time periods to identify optimization opportunities

### Performance Monitoring

Monitoring key metrics helps evaluate voucher effectiveness:

- **Conversion Rate**: Percentage of voucher views that result in usage
- **Revenue Impact**: Net revenue change from voucher campaigns
- **Customer Acquisition**: New customers acquired through vouchers
- **Repeat Usage**: Customers who use vouchers multiple times

### Export Management

Managing analytics exports efficiently ensures data availability:

- Schedule exports during off-peak hours
- Use appropriate formats for your analysis tools
- Clean up old exports to manage storage
- Validate export data before analysis
- Remember exports are automatically deleted after 24 hours
- Download and store important reports locally
