# Voucher API Documentation

A comprehensive, self-initiated project showcasing a hypothetical Voucher API with modern documentation design and interactive features. This project demonstrates advanced API documentation writing capabilities, technical implementation skills, and user experience design principles.

### What This Project Demonstrates

- **Structured API Documentation**: Well-organized reference with endpoints, parameters, and examples
- **Documentation Design**: Modern, responsive layout with consistent typography
- **Interactive Elements**: Code examples with syntax highlighting, tabbed language support, and copy-to-clipboard functionality
- **Technical Implementation**: MkDocs configuration, custom CSS/JS, and build setup
- **Documentation Features**: Authentication guides, error handling examples, and webhook integration
- **Navigation and Accessibility**: Clear navigation, search functionality, and responsive design for mobile devices

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

The Voucher API documentation is built using MkDocs with custom styling and interactive elements. The following instructions describe how to:

- Install dependencies and set up the development environment  
- Run a local development server for live editing and preview  
- Build the documentation site for production deployment
 
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- pip (Python package manager)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd voucher-api-docs
   ```

2. **Set up virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Local Development

1. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   mkdocs serve
   ```

2. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:8000` to view the documentation

3. **Make changes**
   Edit markdown files in the `docs/` directory and see live updates

### Building for Production

The built site will be available in the `site/` directory.

```bash
mkdocs build
```
## üöÄ Deployment

The documentation site is deployed automatically on **Vercel** and accessible at [voucher-api-docs.vercel.app](https://voucher-api-docs.vercel.app).

## üîß Technical Stack

- **Markdown**: Primary authoring format for all documentation content
- **MkDocs**: Static site generator for documentation
- **Material for MkDocs**: Modern, responsive theme
- **PyMdown Extensions**: Enhanced Markdown features
- **Diataxi Framework**: Documentation structure and content organization guidelines
- **Custom CSS/JS**: Tailored styling and interactive elements
- **Python**: Development environment and build tools
- **Vercel**: Hosting platform for the documentation site
